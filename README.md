# Chemical Compounds Problem

This project consists of reading data for the chemical compounds linear programming problem and, with this data, generating an appropriate output to be used by _lp_solve_.

To model the problem, we first considered what the decision variables would be. Since the objective is to maximize the company's profit through the sale of products, it is clear that the decision variables are the quantities $x_i$ produced of each product $i$. The coefficient of each variable is the profit obtained for each product, that is, the selling price $v_i$ minus the production costs $p_j$ of each compound $j$ times the amount $c_{ij}$ present in the product. The constraints of the problem are the limits $q_j$ of each compound. To establish the amount of each compound produced, the amount $c_{ij}$ of that compound present in each product $i$ was multiplied by the quantity $x_i$ produced of each product. Additionally, all quantities $x_i$ must be non-negative.

In the main function, two variables were created to store the quantity $n$ of products and the quantity $m$ of compounds. A vector of _double_ containing the prices of the $n$ products and a _double_ matrix $m \times 2$, where each row $j$ contains the cost and limit of each compound $j$, were also created. Additionally, another $n \times m$ matrix was created where each row $i$ represents a product, each column $j$ represents a compound, and the value $c_{ij}$ is the amount of compound $j$ in product $i$.

After the data is stored in memory, the created variables are passed as parameters to the function _lp_solve_format_, which prints the problem in a format suitable for _lp_solve_ to the standard output. This format was generated by writing the objective function followed by each of the constraints. Each equation of the problem was written on separate lines and separated by semicolons.
